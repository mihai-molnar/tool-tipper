# Hotspot Limits & Upgrade Modal Implementation

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive hotspot tracking and upgrade modal system to enforce freemium limits and encourage Pro plan upgrades.

## Features Implemented

### ðŸŽ¯ Upgrade Modal Component
**File**: `src/components/UpgradeModal.tsx`

- **Professional design** with crown icon and gradient styling
- **Contextual messaging** for signed-in vs anonymous users  
- **Clear value proposition** - $1.99/month Pro plan with unlimited hotspots
- **Feature comparison** - Checklist of Pro benefits
- **Smart CTAs** - "Sign Up & Upgrade" for anonymous, "Upgrade Now" for signed-in users
- **Responsive modal** with smooth transitions and proper accessibility

### ðŸ”’ Server-Side Enforcement
**File**: `src/app/api/hotspot/route.ts`

**Authenticated Users (Free Plan)**:
- Queries `user_profiles` table to check plan type
- Counts total hotspots across all user's projects
- Enforces 10 hotspot limit across entire account
- Returns `402 Payment Required` with `FREE_LIMIT_REACHED` error

**Anonymous Users**:
- Counts hotspots for current page only
- Enforces 10 hotspot limit per individual image
- Returns `402 Payment Required` with `ANONYMOUS_LIMIT_REACHED` error

**Pro Users**:
- No limits enforced (unlimited hotspots)
- Normal flow continues without interruption

### âš¡ Client-Side Logic  
**File**: `src/app/edit/[slug]/page.tsx`

**Pre-flight Checks**:
- Uses AuthContext `canCreateHotspot()` for signed-in users
- Local counting for anonymous users (per-page limit)
- Shows upgrade modal before making API call when possible

**API Response Handling**:
- Detects `402` status code from server
- Removes optimistic UI update
- Triggers upgrade modal display
- Proper error handling with toast notifications

**Usage Tracking**:
- Refreshes AuthContext usage data after successful operations
- Real-time updates for accurate limit checking
- Works for both hotspot creation and deletion

### ðŸ“Š AuthContext Integration
**Enhanced Methods**:
- `canCreateHotspot()` - Checks if user can create more hotspots
- `getRemainingHotspots()` - Returns remaining free hotspots
- `refreshUsage()` - Updates usage data after operations
- Fallback handling when database tables don't exist

## User Experience Flow

### Anonymous Users
1. **Create hotspots freely** - Up to 10 per image
2. **Hit limit** - 11th attempt shows upgrade modal
3. **Modal content** - "Sign up to track your usage and upgrade for unlimited hotspots!"
4. **CTA** - "Sign Up & Upgrade" button leads to registration

### Free Plan Users  
1. **Create hotspots across projects** - Up to 10 total
2. **Real-time tracking** - Usage updates in header and home page
3. **Hit limit** - 11th attempt shows upgrade modal
4. **Modal content** - "You've used 10 of 10 free hotspots. Upgrade to Pro!"
5. **CTA** - "Upgrade Now" button (ready for Stripe integration)

### Pro Users
1. **Unlimited hotspots** - No restrictions or interruptions
2. **Seamless workflow** - No modals or limit checks
3. **Full feature access** - Complete creative freedom

## Technical Implementation

### Error Codes
- `FREE_LIMIT_REACHED` - Authenticated user hit 10 hotspot limit
- `ANONYMOUS_LIMIT_REACHED` - Anonymous user hit 10 per-page limit
- `402 Payment Required` - HTTP status for upgrade-required scenarios

### Database Queries
- Efficient counting queries with proper indexing
- User plan type verification
- Cross-table joins for user hotspot totals
- Graceful fallbacks for missing tables

### UI Components
- Custom modal using Headless UI
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Mobile-responsive design
- Proper focus management and accessibility

### Integration Points
- AuthContext for real-time usage tracking
- Toast system for user feedback
- Header component shows usage stats
- Home page displays remaining hotspots

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `src/components/UpgradeModal.tsx` - Main upgrade modal component
- `src/lib/usage-tracking.ts` - Usage tracking utilities
- `HOTSPOT-LIMITS-IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files
- `src/app/api/hotspot/route.ts` - Server-side limit enforcement
- `src/app/edit/[slug]/page.tsx` - Client-side logic and modal integration
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Enhanced with limit checking methods

## Testing Scenarios

### Anonymous User Flow
1. Create new image at `/new`
2. Add 10 hotspots - should work normally  
3. Try 11th hotspot - upgrade modal appears
4. Modal shows "Sign Up & Upgrade" option

### Free User Flow (Requires Database Setup)
1. Sign up and create account
2. Create hotspots across multiple images
3. Hit 10 total hotspots - upgrade modal appears
4. Modal shows "Upgrade Now" option

### Pro User Flow (Requires Database Setup)
1. Set user plan_type to 'pro' in database
2. Create unlimited hotspots
3. No limits or modals should appear

## Next Steps

### Payment Integration
- Implement Stripe checkout for Pro plan
- Handle webhook events for subscription status
- Update user plan_type after successful payment

### Database Setup
- Run `database/auth-schema.sql` to create required tables
- Set up user_profiles and user_usage tables
- Configure RLS policies properly

### Enhanced Features
- Usage dashboard for Pro users
- Billing management interface  
- Plan comparison page
- Usage analytics and insights

## Dependencies
- `@headlessui/react` - Modal component framework
- `lucide-react` - Icons (Crown, Check, Zap, X)
- Next.js App Router - API routes and client components
- Supabase - Database queries and authentication
- Tailwind CSS - Styling and responsive design
