# Tool-Tipper Development Session Notes

**Date**: 2025-08-10  
**Status**: ✅ **FULLY FUNCTIONAL** - Production Ready

## 🎯 What Was Accomplished

### ✅ Complete Implementation
- **Full-stack app**: Next.js 14 + Supabase + TypeScript
- **Upload workflow**: Image upload with validation
- **Interactive editor**: Click-to-create hotspots with inline editing
- **Public sharing**: Read-only view with hover tooltips
- **Responsive design**: Works on desktop and mobile

### ✅ Key Features Implemented
1. **Image Upload** (`/new`)
   - Drag & drop interface with validation
   - File type and size limits (10MB max, PNG/JPG/WebP)
   - Optional title setting

2. **Edit Mode** (`/edit/{slug}?token={edit_token}`)
   - Click image to add hotspots
   - Inline text editing with save/cancel
   - Delete hotspots with confirmation
   - Edit page title
   - Copy share/edit links

3. **Public View** (`/{slug}`)
   - Hover tooltips on hotspots
   - Read-only interface
   - Share functionality

### ✅ Technical Improvements Made

#### Image Display & Sizing
- **Responsive images**: `max-h-[70vh]` prevents scrolling
- **Centered layout**: Images centered within containers
- **Aspect ratio preserved**: Uses `object-contain`

#### Hotspot Positioning
- **Fixed coordinate system**: Handles image centering and scaling
- **Percentage-based storage**: Hotspots scale with image
- **Accurate click detection**: Properly converts click positions

#### UI/UX Enhancements
- **Semi-transparent hotspots**: 70% opacity, 100% on hover
- **Smart tooltip positioning**: Flips above/below based on space
- **Better spacing**: Comfortable gap between tooltips and hotspots
- **Proper input styling**: Dark text in all form fields
- **Edit mode tooltips**: Preview text on hover before editing

#### Security
- **No API key leakage**: Only anon key exposed (by design)
- **RLS policies**: Database-level security
- **Edit token validation**: Server-side verification
- **Safe environment setup**: No service role key needed

## 🚀 Current Status

### Working Features
- ✅ Upload images from `/new`
- ✅ Add hotspots by clicking on images
- ✅ Edit hotspot text inline
- ✅ Delete hotspots with confirmation
- ✅ View tooltips on hover (both edit and view modes)
- ✅ Copy share and edit links
- ✅ Public view with read-only tooltips
- ✅ Responsive image sizing
- ✅ Mobile-friendly interface

### Database & Storage
- ✅ PostgreSQL schema with RLS
- ✅ Image storage in Supabase bucket
- ✅ Proper permissions and policies
- ✅ No service role key required

## 📋 Setup Instructions

### For New Development Sessions

1. **Environment Setup**:
   ```bash
   cd tool-tipper
   npm install
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Add your Supabase URL and anon key to .env.local
   ```

2. **Database Setup** (if not done):
   - Run `database/schema.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
   - Create `images` bucket in Supabase Storage (public)
   - Apply storage policies from `SETUP.md`

3. **Start Development**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Visit `/new` - upload image works
- [ ] Click on image in edit mode - hotspot creation works
- [ ] Edit hotspot text - inline editing works
- [ ] Hover over hotspots - tooltips show properly
- [ ] Visit public URL - read-only view works
- [ ] Copy share/edit links - clipboard functionality works

```

### Key Components

**ImageCanvas**:
- Handles image display and responsive sizing
- Manages hotspot positioning with coordinate conversion
- Provides click-to-create functionality

**Hotspot**:
- Renders individual hotspot dots (semi-transparent)
- Shows tooltips with smart positioning (flips based on space)
- Handles inline editing in edit mode

### API Routes
- `POST /api/page` - Create new page
- `GET /api/page/{slug}` - Get page data + hotspots
- `PATCH /api/page/{slug}` - Update page (requires edit token)
- `POST /api/upload` - Upload image file
- `POST /api/hotspot` - Create hotspot (requires edit token)
- `PATCH /api/hotspot/{id}` - Update hotspot (requires edit token)
- `DELETE /api/hotspot/{id}` - Delete hotspot (requires edit token)

## 🎯 Potential Future Enhancements

### User Experience
- [ ] Drag & drop to reposition existing hotspots
- [ ] Image zoom/pan for large images
- [ ] Bulk operations (select multiple hotspots)
- [ ] Undo/redo functionality
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts

### Features
- [ ] Export hotspot data as JSON
- [ ] Import existing hotspot data
- [ ] Template system for common hotspot layouts
- [ ] Analytics/view tracking
- [ ] Custom hotspot icons/colors

### Technical
- [ ] Image compression before upload
- [ ] Lazy loading for large images
- [ ] Real-time collaboration (Supabase Realtime)
- [ ] Rate limiting on API routes
- [ ] CDN integration for images

### Admin Features
- [ ] Admin dashboard to manage all pages
- [ ] Bulk delete pages
- [ ] Usage analytics
- [ ] User management (if auth added)

## 🔍 Known Issues & Considerations

### Current Limitations
- **No user authentication**: Anyone can create pages
- **Public images**: All uploaded images are publicly accessible
- **No page management**: No way to list/manage created pages
- **No expiration**: Pages persist indefinitely

### Performance Notes
- Images are served directly from Supabase Storage
- Hotspot data is minimal (coordinates + text)
- Database queries are optimized with indexes

### Security Notes
- Edit tokens are unguessable 32-character strings
- RLS policies prevent unauthorized database access
- Only anonymous Supabase key is exposed (by design)
- All mutations require valid edit tokens

## 📝 Development Notes

- **No service role key required**: Simplified architecture using RLS
- **Coordinate system**: Percentages for responsive positioning
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error messages and loading states
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus management
- **Mobile support**: Touch events, responsive design
